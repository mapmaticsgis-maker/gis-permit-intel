DLS proximity pilot: flags new TX RRC permits within 5 miles of DLS's actual
job-site boundaries, using real shapefile geometry rather than county-level
corridors. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-dls-proximity-pilot-design.md.

Standalone report -- not wired into the daily email while unproven. Reads
already-computed data/tx/out/<date>/new_permits.csv rather than pulling new
data itself.

Run: python dls_proximity_report.py [YYYY-MM-DD]   (defaults to today)
